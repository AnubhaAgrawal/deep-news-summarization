# News summarization
News summarization using sequence to sequence model in TensorFlow.

# Introduction
This repo is a demonstration of abstractive summarization of news article exploiting [sequence to sequence model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq/). This model is trainined on newswires from 1994-2004 Associated Press Worldstream (APW) from English gigaword second edition. The examples below were the results of the model trained using AWS EC2 g2.2xlarge
instance for 10 epochs, which took around 20 hours.
